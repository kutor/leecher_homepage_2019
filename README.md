# leecher_homepage_2019
A remake of my band's homepage I did in 2016 with only basic HTML/CSS/JS knowledge then.

Now I remade it to work like a decent webpage. 

I am well aware that using React is completely unnecessary for this kind of webpage, but I had to practice it and it doesn't hurt either.

Planning to add some features as well.
